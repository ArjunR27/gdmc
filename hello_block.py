# Tip: to get the ID of a block in Minecraft (like "red_concrete"), press F3 and point at the
# the block. The ID will be shown at the bottom right, below "Targeted Block". You can leave out the

#
# To get the ID of a block in your inventory, you can also press F3 + H and then hover over the
# block. The ID should be shown at the bottom of the tooltip.
#
# You can also "delete" a block by placing Block("air") at its position.
